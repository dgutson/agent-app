# agent-app — project instructions

## Roadmap

This repo is governed by ROADMAP.md (pending work) and HISTORY.md (completed work).

- **Start here for context.** ROADMAP.md is the durable record of work that is established
  but unfinished. Read it rather than reconstructing the state of play from git history,
  old conversations, or a sweep of the code.
- Items are grouped **Now / Next / Later**. To choose what to work on, take the first item
  under the earliest horizon whose **Blocked-by** entries are no longer present in the file.
- When you finish an item: delete it from ROADMAP.md, add a line under today's date at the
  top of HISTORY.md recording the outcome **actually** achieved, and drop its ID from the
  **Blocked-by** list of every item it was blocking.
- When **Now** empties, promote the readiest items from **Next**, so the file keeps
  answering "what should I be doing" rather than going quiet.
- ROADMAP.md holds pending work only. Never mark an item done in place — removal is what
  "done" means here.

## This plugin lints itself

Run `python3 scripts/lint_agent_app.py --root .` before considering any change done. It
must exit 0. The plugin argues that a skill and its tool have to be kept in agreement;
shipping one that fails its own check would settle the argument the wrong way.
